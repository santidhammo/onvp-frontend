# The ONVP Frontend

This project contains the frontend application of the ONVP website. In association with the ONVP Backend, 
it provides the capabilities of the website for the ONVP. You are more than welcome to use this code for 
your own use, as long as you apply the terms of the license as described in the COPYING.md file (AGPL).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically 
reload if you change any of the source files. Note that you require a proxy server running the ONVP
backend application and provide it on the port as specified by the `src/proxy.conf.json` file.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command,
you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
